# TINDER COPILOT

Imagine if you had Github Copilot, but for rizz...

...you don't have to imagine anymore, I made it as a Chrome extension.



## Usage

Tinder Copilot utilizes Gemini-2.5-Flash from AI Studio

For now, you need to paste your Google AIStudio API Key into the first line of content.js

Tinder Copilot will automatically add so-called Rizz buttons to your Tinder conversation

"Evaluate Messages" will evaluate your messages chess.com-style, e.g. Blunder, Book Move etc.

"Rizz me" will take the whole conversation and suggest a next message for your Tinder Match

## Installation

In order to install the extension, either clone the repository or download it as .ZIP and unpack it

Next, go to chrome://extensions, check "Developer mode" and "Install unpacked" and select the repository folder



## TODO

- Add Google login button and automate getting API key
- Add official Google GenAI SDK support (js fetch() only for now)
- Add more languages support (Only Polish is supported for now, may work with other languages but not guaranteed)
- Adjust prompts in order to get better suggestions from AI
- Release it to the chrome extension store
